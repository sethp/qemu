urgent:

dss support for omap3
mcspi fixup for omap3
uart revision for omap3


consider: 

rename omap2_l4ta_init -> omap2_l4ta_get
rename omap3_l4ta_init -> omap3_l4ta_get

refactor omap3_mmc from a "qdev" to whatever happened to the omap2 mmc and uarts

what counts as an MMC sd card, and when might that be turned on? So far it's always false

does omap_dma need to be target-specific (usage of ldl_p)?
